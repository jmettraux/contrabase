Overview
The AK-74 is a selective fire assault rifle that is chambered to fire the ubiquitous 5.45Ã—39 mm round.

It loads from 30-round plastic magazines, is capable of attaining a fire rate of up to 650 rounds per minute, and has a muzzle velocity of 900 m/s. The AK-74 is accurate at distances of up to 400 metres.

Replacing the long-outdated AK-47, the AK-74 is the latest model in the Kalashnikov assault rifle family. It is primarily used by the Soviet Armed Forces, though stocks of AK-74s have also fallen into the hands of anti-Soviet resistance groups.

Unlike the older AK-47, the AK-74 fires the smaller but lighter 5.45 mm round. Though it has reduced stopping power compared to the AK-47's 7.62 mm, the AK-74 makes up for it by being far more accurate at distances of beyond 250 metres. In addition, it has much less recoil which renders it easier to control when firing on full auto.

In some respects, the AK-74 is slightly superior to its American counterpart in close quarters. Whereas the M16A2 is limited to a 3-round burst fire mode only, the AK-74 has access to all three modes (semi-auto, burst, full auto) and does not leave its user vulnerable should they miss their initial shots.
